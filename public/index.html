          -Input flow hasn't been established yet- we aren't asking questions when asking the user for an image, and we aren't taking them to a more evocative+instructive page as Peng has laid out. We should chat about this flow one more time, because I'm not certain which image is the source of truth right now.
        </li>
        <li>
          -User's realtime experience (seeing immediate change in the site when entering images) isn't very good yet. We should chat about the finer points of that- it's good to show them a realtime view of the image they just took, but it kind of spoils the experience that they're meant to have when they first see their entry in the list.
        </li>
        <li>
          -Landscape mode is a mess. We need to decide what to do there. It's not much effort to make that work, but we should mock it up.
        </li>
        <li>
          -We don't have a high-quality "thanks for submitting!" message for the user. I think we should be deliberate about how that message leads them to the next step.
        </li>
        <li>
          -As a user, I really want a way to 'zoom into' these pictures.
        </li>
        <li>
          -There is no CDN set up currently, so performance won't be consistent everywhere.
        </li>
        <li>
          -The user has to scroll to the bottom to retrieve older posts, and they come in batches of 10. We can control batch size. I think we need some kind of indication that they ought to scroll to the bottom.
        </li>
        <li>
          -It's really easy to upload big images straight from the phone camera. If we're only ever going to display this site on a phone, I should create a service that shrinks the uploaded images. Effort isn't too bad on this.
        </li>
        <li>
          -This has been free of cost so far.
